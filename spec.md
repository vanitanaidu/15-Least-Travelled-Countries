# Specifications for the CLI Assessment

Specs:
- [x] Have a CLI for interfacing with the application (CLI_interface.rb has the code necessary to run the program)

- [x] Pull data from an external source # (scraper.rb has all the information I need for this program to run. I did all the scrapping from the website http://www.thisisinsider.com/the-least-visited-countries-in-the-world-2015-7)

- [x] Implement both list and detail views (My program has a list of 15 countries. Users can choose 1 or more countries they would like more information on.)
